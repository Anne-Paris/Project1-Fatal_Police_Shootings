# Project1: Fatal Police Shootings: Who is at risk?
MATH-3439-01 Project 1

Police shootings have been at the forefront of the debates surrounding police reforms and police brutality. While these issues are complex, we wanted to focus our attention on one question: are there specific demographics that get targeted more than any other? 
To answer this question, we explored various factors such as: race, age, gender, household median income by city, percentage of residents by city who live below the federal poverty level, education, incidence of mental illness and geographic location. We then set out to see which of these factors play an important role in police fatal shootings, and if these factors combined could give us a “most-at-risk” profile.

## Where is our data from?
The dataset we used was compiled by the Washington Post Fatal Force Dataset. It provides data about each police-involved killing in the United States in 2015 and includes: City and State of the incident, the race, gender, and age of the deceased, and whether they were armed or experiencing a mental-health crisis. We combined this dataset with data on poverty rate, population, education rate, mental illness rate, and race distribution by cities from the US Census.

## Summary: who is at risk? What factors do matter?
As we demonstrated, the demographic the most likely to be fatally shot by the police is a black male between the ages of 20 - 24, with approximately 304 incidents per 1 million. This demographic demonstrates that race, gender, and age play a major role in whether someone is fatally shot by the police or not. Mental illness was also determined to be another factor that impacts whether someone is fatally shot by the police, with the occurrence of mental illness among shooting victims as high as 40% in some states. When looking into median income, education, and poverty rate, the results were inconclusive. Overall the factors race, gender, age, and mental illness have a significant impact, while we could not determine a correlation with median income, education, and poverty rate.
